# MASE2 Optimus theme

## About and purpose

**Optimus** is a free and home-made Magento 2 theme, developed by [Studio Emma](http://www.studioemma.com) . Its purpose is providing a starting point for the development of our own client projects. It's a solid base to extend the Magento 2 Blank theme with functionality & styling without breaking future upgrades. It is continuously being worked on, both refined and expanded. All added changes and new features are extends; we try to stay away from overrides until there is absolutely no other way possible.

It comprises of the following:

* module-core (separate composer install) with several helper functions which can be of use throughout your own client theme.
* module-optimus (separate composer install) which stands in for our example content pages at [rooturl]/content. More on that later.
* theme-frontend-optimus (separate composer install) which is the actual front-end theme and works together with the two above.

Optimus works with Magento 2, starting from the initial 2.0.0 BETA all the way up to the current 2.1.2 release.

## Demo

[Demo available](http://magento2.optimus.studioemma.com/) with a list of [extra features](http://magento2.optimus.studioemma.com/content). (Note: this is a base theme and it is does not look pretty by itself.)

## Module-core
This module contains a lot of handy helper functions:

* getCurrentStore() : returns the current store
* getLocale() : returns the current locale
* getCurrentCategory() : returns the current category
* getParentCategory() : returns the parent category of the current category
* getCurrentProduct: returns the current product, if available
* getBackUrl() : returns the back url value when browsing products or categories
* isLoggedIn() : return boolean if user is or is not logged in
* getCurrentCustomer() : if logged in, returns current customer object
* getCurrentCustomerGroup() : if logged in, returns current customer group object

## Module-optimus
This module contains the necessary files in order to build the example content pages. After you installed Optimus, navigate to **[rooturl]/content**. These pages were setup to give you a visual overview of all of our content-related changes. This includes basic layout (titles, lists, quotes, ...), page/section layouts (grids, sections, structures ...), interaction elements (accordeons, FAQs, toggles, ...), reusable classes, specific contentblocks, images and videos, ...

## Theme-frontend-optimus
This module contains the front-end theme itself. We divide our work into two main sections:

* **Changes**: Extends the blank theme with changes to its functionality, styling and technologies according to our experience throughout the years.
* **New features**: Extends the blank theme with new features that are of interest to most our clients. These can easily activated/deactivated when needed.

### Technicalities

* The theme inherits from the Magento Blank theme.
* The theme itself is declared in theme.xml. This file is a necessity for all Magento 2 themes and contains information about inheritance.
* The composer.json file contains the dependency information required for this theme.

### Installation
The modules are intended to be installed using composer. If you do not have composer installed (check by entering the command "composer --help" into your terminal), please install it using the following commands:

```
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer
```

After installing composer, use the following commands to install Optimus to your Magento 2 installation:

```
composer require studioemma/magento2-theme-optimus
```

After installing "Studio Emma Mase 2 Optimus" theme, you can verify that the installation succeeded by going to the Magento 2 back-end and navigating to **Content -> Design -> Themes**. If it listed there, you should be happy.

Normally, this theme will never be set as a the main theme for a client, but to set this theme for development purposes on the storefront, go to: **Content -> Design -> Configuration** and set the Optimus theme on the Store View you wish to use. Do not forget to flush the cache afterwards.

### Using Optimus as the base theme for your own client theme
A client project will inherit from the Optimus theme. To do this, set the theme.xml of your own client's theme inside the client's package to inherit from Studioemma/optimus.

```
<theme xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="../../../../../lib/internal/Magento/Framework/Config/etc/theme.xsd">
    <title>Own client name - Own theme name</title>
    <parent>Studioemma/optimus</parent>
    <media>
        <preview_image>media/preview.jpg</preview_image>
    </media>
</theme>
```

Because of the Magento 2 inheritance system, we had to create an additional _**extend-custom.less** file per module. This means that all of your client theme, module-specific, styling should be added in this file!

An example. You want to edit the footer for your client theme:

* Add the "Magento_Theme" folder inside your app/design/frontend/ClientPackage/ClientTheme/ folder structure
* Add the web/css/source folder structure inside your newly created "Magento_Theme" folder
* Create the _extend-custom.less file inside the newly created "source" folder
* Make changes in this file
* Watch your Grunt process this file using the "grunt watch" command in the webroot of your box.
* Reload the front, your changes should be visible
* It is possible though that Grunt won't pick up your newly created file. In this case, simply stop watching and re-watch using, again, the "grunt watch" command. Re-save the file and Grunt should pick it up.

### Configuring grunt (development purposes only)
You need to configure Grunt in order to work with your theme and pick up the Optimus files too, open /dev/tools/grunt/configs/themes.js and put in a new config for your theme like in our example below. Only replace the items between curly brackets {{item}}.

```
{{themename}}: {
    area: 'frontend',
    name: '{{themepackage}}/{{themefolder}}',
    locale: 'en_US',
    files: [
        'css/optimus-m',
        'css/optimus-l',
        'css/styles-m',
        'css/styles-l',
        'css/print',
        'css/email',
        'css/email-inline'
    ],
    dsl: 'less'
```

Next : run the following command that generate symlinks to the .less files that are watched by grunt (see command below) when you edit the source .less files (see next command). You need to re-run this command every time files are added/deleted.
```
bin/magento dev:source-theme:deploy --theme=vendor/theme --locale=en_US css/styles-m css/optimus-m css/styles-l css/optimus-l css/print css/email css/email-inline

```

Run grunt watch in the webroot of your box.
```
grunt watch

```
